# BDCC Projects

These projects were made in the Big Data and Cloud Computing curricular unit on the first year of the MERSI master in FCUP.
The first project is based on the first part of the course, Big Data, where we develop an app in Google Cloud for image classifications making use of several Google Cloud services such as BigQuery, AppEngine, CloudRun and Vertex AI.
The second project is based on the second part of the course, Cloud Computing, where we explore the private cloud software OpenNebula and create a Cloud Infrastructure that runs OpenNebula's commands.
